# Dok-jam

This is an initial prototype of Dok programming language (https://www.dokmelody.org), DokMelody IDE, and Doknil knowledge-base language, developed in Clojure for the 2020 https://repl.it Programming Language Jam.

## Mission

Win the Jam! :-)

Have fun creating something of original and hopefully better than current main stream tools, combining some good original idea or 
taking inspiration from papers. 

Use DokMelody for designing and improving Dok language, and this project, in "eat your own dog food" style.

It is all in alpha/design/development state: many things can not work, all can change.
